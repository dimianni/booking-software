## Why This Project Is Special to Me

This project is particularly important to me for its interesting mix of technologies:

- Use of CockroachDB, a database adopted by leading companies such as Netflix.
- Use of Prisma, which has streamlined database operations, making them more intuitive and efficient.
- Use of JWT was implemented for authentication and route protection, providing a secure and efficient method for managing admin sessions.
- Use of AWS S3 for image storage.
- Use of Checkout.com Hosted Payments solution, providing secure and user-friendly payment processing capabilities.
- This app also marks my first experience with TypeScript, enhancing the development process through improved type safety and developer experience.

Each technology was chosen not only for its direct benefits to the project but also for the opportunity it presented for professional growth and learning.
